# 🧠 HDLBits – Verilog Practice Solutions

This repository contains my **140+ Verilog HDL solutions** from [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/) — a platform to learn and practice digital logic and RTL design through hands-on exercises.

Over the past **1.5+ months**, I’ve been solving problems consistently, covering everything from logic gates to FSMs. This journey helped me sharpen my understanding of **hardware-level design, modular Verilog coding**, and **simulation-ready RTL**.

## 🔧 Topics Covered

- ✅ Logic Gates  
- ✅ Vectors & Bit Manipulations  
- ✅ Combinational Circuits  
- ✅ Multiplexers, Decoders, Encoders  
- ✅ Arithmetic Circuits (Adders, Subtractors)  
- ✅ Sequential Circuits  
- ✅ Flip-Flops, Counters, Shift Registers  
- ✅ FSMs (Moore & Mealy)  
- ✅ Procedural Verilog (`always`, `if`, `case`)  
- ✅ Hierarchical & Modular Design
